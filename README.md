## üöÄ How to publish this package

- Make sure you have the latest version set in `package.json`
- Also take some time and explain the changes in the `CHANGELOG.md` file
- It's always good to tag the current `main` branch into a tag

```bash
git tag -a v1.1.10 -m "1.1.10"
git push origin v1.1.10
```

(replace `v1.1.10` with the version you want to publish)

- Create also a release: go to [this link](https://github.com/uqbar-project/wollok-web-tools/releases/new), and create a new release with the tag you just created. 
  - The title should be the version number (no 'v' prefix)
  - The description should be the changes in the `CHANGELOG.md` file
  - Uncheck "Set as a pre-release"
  - Check "Set as the latest release"
  - Click "Publish release"

- Run `npm run build` in order to generate `dist` folder
- Then simply run

```bash
npm publish
```

You'll need a npm user with publishing permissions.
